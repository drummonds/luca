Python accounting tools for transactions and trial balance manipulation.

The first version of this was quite different using a SQLite database.

I am relooking at an abtract representation of accounts and transactions based on plain text accounting.

Using beancount as a reference there are a number of changes:

1. Support from microsecond based ordering of events
2. Aiming to support small numbers of transactions eg up to 10,000
3. Storage an conversion to a text/json
   a) the text format will not have an ordering
4. Support for bitemporal functions which will be used to support a knowledge date
5. Suport fo digital twins for comparing two similar list of transactions perhaps with one generated dynamically

The exploration will be done in ipython notebooks in directory notes

# Introduction

My aim here is use plain text accounting to create a simple python model for modelling accounting. This will be used to answer such questions as what is the balance of an account at time x

A great collection of reference material on plain text accounting is here https://plaintextaccounting.org/ and I particulary want to highlight Martin Kleppmann https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/07/accounting-for-computer-scientists.html

# EBNF definition of text format

Using the language of Martin Blais Beancount https://beancount.github.io/docs/beancount_language_syntax.html#syntax-overview

Current it is a lot simplified:

- no option entries
- no commodities
- no currencies
- no balance postings

I have tried to document it use W3C EBNF description https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-notation

```ebnf

```

Notes:
For directives apart from transactions full_date is assumed at the start of the day, and for transactions one microsecond before the end of the day.

The resolution of datetime is assumed to be 1 microsecond

## Signs

The accounting equation is:

$$ Assets = Liabilities + Equity + Income âˆ’ Expenses$$

Where:

$$Equity = ContributedCapital - Dividends$$

In a computer system we usually use +ve and -ve to as opposed to Credit and Debit which are the traditional accounting forms of increasing and decreasing then the equation is:

$$ Assets - Liabilities - Equity - Income + Expenses = 0$$

So this give you:

| Account Types | Increase |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Assets        | +        |
| Liabilities   | -        |
| Equity        | -        |
| Income        | -        |
| Expenses      | +        |
